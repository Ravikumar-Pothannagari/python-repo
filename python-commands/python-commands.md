# All Python Commands

# python version
    To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe)
    
    C:\Users\Your Name>python --version

# run a python file
    C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py

# The Python Command Line
    To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.

    Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:

        C:\Users\Your Name>python

        From there you can write any python, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial:
        Which will write "Hello, World!" in the command line:

        Example:
            C:\Users\RavikumarPothannagar\git\ravikumar-pothannagari\python-repo> python
            Python 3.8.5 (tags/v3.8.5:580fbb0, Jul 20 2020, 15:57:54) [MSC v.1924 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
            Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
            >>> print("hello world")
            hello world
            >>> exit() 

        Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit the python command line interface:
            
            exit()
